# Data Directory

This directory is used to persist disk monitoring data.

- **disks.json**: This file is automatically generated by the server and contains the latest SMART data for all monitored disks.
- It is mounted as a volume in the Docker container at `/app/data`.

**Note:** The actual data files (`.json`) are ignored by Git to prevent committing production data.
